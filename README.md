# golang
learning golang. putting stuff here

thoughts:
- go mod tidy <3
- i like how return types for functions are after the arguments
- slices are just lua tables, but also similar syntax lets you set fixed lengths
- super easy to track dependencies and such. repo-based collabs ahoy
- nested scope with curly braces, yum
